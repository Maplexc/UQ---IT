As featured in the Flying Circus TV Show - Episode 42

Father Graham
    I say
    
Daughter Carol
    Yes daddy 
 
Father
    Croquet hoops look damn pretty this afternoon

Daughter
    Frightfully damn pretty
 
Mother Eric
    They're coming along awfully well this year

Father
    Yes better than your Aunt Lavinia's croquet hoops 

Daughter
    Ugh dreadful tin things

Mother
    I did tell her to stick to wood

Father
    Yes you can't beat wood Gorn!

Mother
    What's gorn dear? 

Father
    Nothing, nothing, I just like the word. It gives me confidence. Gorn ... gorn. It's got a sort of woody quality about it. Gorn. Gorn. Much better than `newspaper' or `litterbin'. 

  
Daughter
    Frightful words. 


Mother
    Perfectly dreadful. 


Father
    Ugh! Newspaper! ... litterbin ... dreadful tinny sort of words. Tin, tin, tin. 


The daughter bursts into tears.

Mother
    Oh, dear, don't say `tin' to Rebecca, you know how it upsets her. 

Father
    (to the daughter) Sorry old horse. 


Mother
    Sausage! 

Father
    Sausage ... there's a good woody sort of word, `sausage' ... gorn. 

Daughter
    Antelope. 

Father
    Where? On the lawn? (he picks up a rifle) 

Daughter
    No, no, daddy ... just the word. 

Father
    Don't want an antelope nibbling the hoops. 

Daughter
    No, antelope ... sort of nice and woody type of thing. 

Mother
    Don't think so, Becky old chap. 

Father
    No, no, `antelope', `antelope' -- tinny sort of word (the daughter bursts into tears) Oh! Sorry old man ... 


Mother
    Really, Mansfield. 

Father
    Well, she's got to come to terms with these things ... seemly ... prodding ... vacuum ... leap ... 

  
Daughter
    (miserably) Hate leap. 


Mother
    Perfectly dreadful. 


Daughter
    Sort of PVC-y sort of word, don't you know. 


Mother
    Lower-middle. 

Father
    Bound! 
   
Mother
    Now you're talking. 



Father
    Bound ... Vole ... Recidivist. 


Mother
    Bit tinny. (the daughter howls) Oh! Sorry, Becky old beast. (the daughter runs out crying) 


Father
    Oh dear, suppose she'll be gorn for a few days now. 

  
Mother
    Caribou! 


Father
    Splendid word. 

Mother
    No dear ... nibbling the hoops. 


Father
    (he fires a shot) Caribou gorn. 

 
Mother
    (laughs politely) 


Father
    Intercourse. 

Mother
    Later, dear. 
  
Father
    No, no, the word, `intercourse' -- good and woody ... inter ... course ... pert ... pert thighs ... botty, botty, botty ... (the mother leaves the room) ... erogenous ... zone ... concubine ... erogenous zone! Loose woman ... erogenous zone ... (the mother returns and throws a bucket of water over him) Oh thank you, dear ... you know, it's a funny thing, dear ... all the naughty words sound woody. 


Mother
    Really, dear? ... How about tit? 

Father
    Oh dear, I hadn't thought about that. Tit. Tit. Oh, that's very tinny isn't it? (the daughter returns) Ugh! Tinny, tinny ... (the daughter runs out crying) Oh dear ... ocelot ... wasp ... yowling ... Oh dear, I'm bored ... I'd better go and have a bath, I suppose. 



Mother
    Oh really, must you dear? You've had nine today. 


 Father
    All right, I'll sack one of the servants ... Simkins! ... nasty tinny sort of name. Simkins! (he exits) 




A pilot from the RAF banter scene enters.

Pilot (Michael)
    I say, mater, cabbage crates coming over the briny. 


Mother
    (frowns and shakes her head) Sorry dear, don't understand. 


Pilot
    Er ... cowcatchers creeping up on the conning towers ... 

Mother
    No ... sorry ... old sport. 


Pilot
    Caribou nibbling at the croquet hoops. 


Mother
    Yes, Mansfield shot one in the antlers. 

Pilot
    Oh, jolly good show. Is 'Becca about? 


Mother
    No, she's gorn off. 
  
Pilot
    What a super woody sort of phrase. `Gorn orff'. 

Mother
    Yes, she's gorn orff because Mansfield said `tin' to her. 

  
Pilot
    Oh, what rotten luck ... oh well ... whole afternoon to kill ... better have a bath I suppose. 

 
Mother
    Oh, Gervaise do sing me a song ... 

 
Pilot
    Oh, OK. 


Mother
    Something woody. 



The pilot launches into a quite enormously loud rendering of `She's going to marry Yum Yum'. The impact of this on the mother causes her to have a heart attack. She dies and the song ends.

Pilot
    For ... she's going to marry Yum Yum ... oh crikey. The old song finished her orff.  


 
Father
    (entering) What's urp? 
 
Pilot
    I'm afraid Mrs Vermin Jones appears to have passed orn. 

 
Father
    Dead, is she? 

Pilot
    'Fraid so. 

Father
    What a blow for her.
